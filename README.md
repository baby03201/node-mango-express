==================
Refering to http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2014/restful-web-app-node-express-mongodb/ 
This website provides us very detailed tutorial to set up the server and how to utilize the function GET, DELETE, POST. 
At the end of tutorial, it also gives the direction to do the rest for updating users. I tried to create a light-weighted web server and also did the PUT practice. 

I was struggling a while doing the practice part. However, I looked into http://garrilla.logdown.com/posts/192327-rest-follow-up-excercise and finally find my solution. Also, I used his toggle function to switch the "Add User" and "Update User" panels in website.
